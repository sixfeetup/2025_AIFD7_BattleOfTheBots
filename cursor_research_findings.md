## ⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION: Anthropic Acquisition Claim

**FINDING: The claim that Cursor was acquired by Anthropic appears to be INCORRECT.**

### Evidence:
1. **No Official Announcement**: There is no official press release or announcement from either Cursor or Anthropic about any acquisition
2. **Website Identity**: Cursor.com maintains its independent branding with no Anthropic references
3. **Company Information**: Cursor is developed by Anysphere Inc., an independent company
4. **Documentation**: Official Cursor documentation makes no mention of being owned by or acquired by Anthropic
5. **Anthropic's Portfolio**: Anthropic's official communications do not list Cursor as part of their company

### Likely Confusion:
- Cursor **uses** Anthropic's Claude AI models as one of several model providers
- This is a **partnership/API integration**, not an acquisition
- Cursor also integrates with OpenAI, Google, and other AI model providers

**VERDICT: Cursor has NOT been acquired by Anthropic. They are an independent company that uses Anthropic's API.**
