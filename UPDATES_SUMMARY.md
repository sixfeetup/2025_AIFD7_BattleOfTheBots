## Key Corrections Made

### 1. **Cursor Ownership Clarification**
- **Old:** "Developed by Cursor team (acquired by Anthropic)"

- **Reason:** No evidence of acquisition exists. Cursor is an independent company that uses Anthropic's API.

### 2. **Claude Code Clarification**
- **Clarified:** Claude Code is an Anthropic coding agent tool
- **Context:** Anthropic offers an official coding agent tool (Claude Code) and third-party tools (like Aider, Cline, etc.) also integrate with Claude via API/MCP
- **What Anthropic Did:** Released MCP as an open protocol for tools to integrate with Claude

### 3. **Junie Status & Capabilities**
- **Old:** "private beta" (implied)
- **New:** "Public Early Access Program"
- **Added:** MCP support, multi-model support

## Recommendations for Presenter

1. **Emphasize the timeline**: The pace of change since April 2025 has been remarkable
2. **MCP is the big story**: It's now a common thread across most tools (except Aider)
3. **Correct misconceptions**: Be ready to clarify that Cursor is independent and there's no "Claude Code" product
4. **Highlight model diversity**: GPT-5, Claude 4, DeepSeek R1 all emerged recently
5. **Note Goose's rapid development**: Went from closed development to full public release with major features in <1 year
