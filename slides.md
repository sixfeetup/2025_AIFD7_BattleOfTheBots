# AI Coding Assistants {.r-fit-text data-background="images/2.png"}
## The New Pair-Programming Partners {.r-fit-text}

### Rapid Evolution over the last year:

> More than 97% of respondents reported having used AI coding tools at work
>
> -- [Github AI in Software Survey](More than 97% of respondents reported having used AI coding tools at work at some point)

# Why This Matters {.r-fit-text data-background="images/9.png"}

- AI coding assistants are transforming how we build software
- Choosing the right tool can mean the difference between frustration and flow
- Let’s find out which one delivers for real-world developers!

---

# What is AI Agent? {data-background="images/4.png"}

An AI agent is a system that can:

- Perceive its environment through tools/APIs
- Make decisions autonomously
- Take actions to achieve specific goals
- Learn from interactions and feedback
- Chain multiple operations together

---

# Agents Continued {data-background="images/4.png"}

Key characteristics:

- Tool use capabilities (file system, web search, code execution)
- Planning and reasoning about complex tasks
- Persistent memory within a session
- Self-improvement through feedback loops

---

# What is MCP? {data-background="images/6.png"}

![](images/Model%20Context%20Protocol%20Diagram.png){.r-stretch .r-frame .r-center}

::: notes
The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build
secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The
architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through
MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these
servers.
:::

---

# MCP Examples {data-background="images/8.png"}

- A [suite of specialized MCP servers](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) for AWS:
  - Saves the cost of having all the AWS docs in your own context
- Use [Playwright from your AI Tools](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)
  - Control a browser and grab the context from various web pages
 
---

# In practice {data-background="images/8.png"}

- Connect your AI assistant to AWS MCP servers
- Ask natural language questions about AWS services
- Get contextually accurate answers based on latest documentation
- Generate AWS CLI commands, CloudFormation templates, or IAM policies
- Troubleshoot AWS-specific issues with current best practices

---

# Agentic Coding Models {data-background="images/1.png"}

![](images/aider_leaderboar.png)

---

# DEMO: The Prompt {data-background="images/4.png"}

> This project was bootstrapped with scaf and has a NextJS frontend in the `frontend` dir and a Django backend in the `backend` dir.
> 
> The scaf template only supports a GraphQL API. Refactor the app to use a REST API.

---

# DEMO: Aider {data-background="images/5.png"}

- Specify conventions in CONVENTIONS.md
- Use different models for architect and edit mode simultaneously
- Use external editor with `/editor`
- Run commands and add to output with `/run`
- Show cost with `/tokens`
- Clear context with `/clear`
- Start with `--lint-command` and `--test-command` run your test suite after
  each time the AI edits your code
 
# DEMO: Claude Code {data-background="images/6.png"}

- Allow tools: `claude config add allowedTools "Bash(git:*),Bash(cat:*),Bash(grep:*)"`
- Specify conventions in CLAUDE.md
- Doesn't use git to commit changes. TIP: Ask it to "Review the staged changes
  with `git diff --staged` and git commit using conventional commit standard"
- Show cost with `/cost`
- Compact and clear context with `/compact` and `/clear`

# DEMO: Cursor {data-background="images/8.png"}

- Specify conventions in Project Rules: .cursor/rules
  https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules
- Optionally add AGENTS.md at the project root or subdirectories; you can also generate rules via /Generate Cursor Rules
 

# DEMO: Goose {data-background="images/9.png"}

- Specify conventions in `.goosehints`:
  Global: `~/.config/goose/.goosehints`
  Local: `.goosehints`
- Session support:
  Start a session: `goose session -n rest-api`
  Exit a session: type exit
  Resume session: `goose session -r rest-api`
- Permission Modes:
  Completely Autonomous / Manual Approval / Smart Approval / Chat Only
- Clear context by exiting `/exit`

# DEMO: Junie {data-background="images/10.png"}

- Specify conventions in `.junie/guidelines.md`
- Use it to help setup those guidelines
- It will require some serious coaxing in complicated setups (like our demo)

---

# Key Takeaways {.r-fit-text data-background="images/3.png"}

- No single assistant is best for every workflow
- MCP is enabling richer, more context-aware coding
- Open source tools are catching up fast
- Try several and see what fits your style!
