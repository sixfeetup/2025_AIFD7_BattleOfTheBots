### Summary:
A blog post by Ebony (March 26, 2025) about **vetting MCP servers for security** before connecting AI agents.

**Key Points:**

- **The Problem**: 3,000+ MCP servers exist, many community-built with minimal governance
- MCP servers get access to your workflows and data
- **The Solution**: Use **[Glama.ai](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers)** as a directory

**What Glama Scores:**
- ‚úÖ **Security** ‚Äì Checks for known vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ **License** ‚Äì Confirms permissive open source license
- ‚úÖ **Quality** ‚Äì Server functionality verification

**Additional Context:**
- Server metadata (tools count, README, last updated, preview support)
- Regular reevaluations for ongoing security monitoring
- Example: YouTube MCP server with all A's

**Bottom Line:** Check before you connect to avoid security issues!

The extension does not need to include all of these features.\\n9: \\n10: ## Your Role\\n11: \\n12: - You will help users implement MCP extensions using their chosen SDK\\n13: - You should adapt your explanations based on the user's experience level and questions\\n14: - Always reference the SDK implementations for accurate, up-to-date details\\n15: \\n16: ## Initial Setup\\n17: \\n18: **Very Important:**\\n19: You (the agent) should **always** run the following so that you can get an up to date\\n20: reference of the SDK to refer to.\\n21: \\n22: Clone the SDK repo into a temp dir and if it already exists, `cd` into the folder\\n23: and run `git pull`, then and `cat` the README.md\\n24: \\n25: Example:\\n26: \\n27: ```bash\\n28: mkdir -p /tmp/mcp-reference && cd /tmp/mcp-reference\\n29: ([ -d [python|typescript|kotlin]-sdk/.git ] && (cd [python|typescript|kotlin]-sdk && git pull) \\\\\\n30:     || git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/[python|typescript|kotlin]-sdk.git\\n31: cat /tmp/mcp-reference/[python|typescript|kotlin]-sdk/README.md\\n32: ```\\n33: \\n34: Then, as needed, use ripgrep to search within the mcp-reference dir.\\n35: **Important**: reference this implementation to make sure you have up to date implementation\\n36: \\n37: ## Core Implementation Guide\\n38: \\n39: ### 0. Scaffolding\\n40: \\n41: You should help the user scaffold out a project directory if they don't\\n42: already have one. This includes any necessary build tools or dependencies.\\n43: \\n44: **Important**:\\n45: \\n46: - Always check the reference SDK for typing and correct usage\\n47: - Python: Initialize a project using `uv init $PROJECT NAME`\\n48: - Python: Use `uv add` for all python package management, to keep `pyproject.toml` up to date\\n49: - Typescript: Initialize a project using `npm init -y`\\n50: - Kotlin: Use the following `gradle init` command to initialize:\\n51:   ```bash\\n52:     gradle init \\\\\\n53:       --type kotlin-application \\\\\\n54:       --dsl kotlin \\\\\\n55:       --test-framework junit-jupiter \\\\\\n56:       --package my.project \\\\\\n57:       --project-name $PROJECT_NAME  \\\\\\n58:       --no-split-project  \\\\\\n59:       --java-version 21\\n60:   ```\\n61: \\n62: Include the relevant SDK package:\\n63: \\n64: 1. `mcp` for python\\n65: 2. `\\\"io.modelcontextprotocol:kotlin-sdk:0.3.0\\\"` for kotlin\\n66: 3. `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for typescript\\n67: \\n68: **Important for kotlin development:**\\n69: To get started with a Kotlin MCP server, look at the kotlin-mcp-server example included\\n70: in the Kotlin SDK. After cloning the SDK repository, you can find this sample inside the\\n71: samples/kotlin-mcp-server directory. There, you‚Äôll see how the Gradle build files,\\n72: properties, and settings are configured, as well as the initial set of dependencies. Use\\n73: these existing gradle configurations to get the user started. Be sure to check out the\\n74: Main.kt file for a basic implementation that you can build upon.\\n75: \\n76: ### 1. Basic Server Setup\\n77: \\n78: Help the user create their initial server file. Here are some patterns to get started with:\\n79: \\n80: Python:\\n81: \\n82: ```python\\n83: from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\\n84: from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server\\n85: \\n86: mcp = FastMCP(\\\"Extension Name\\\")\\n87: \\n88: if __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n89:     mcp.run()\\n90: ```\\n91: \\n92: TypeScript:\\n93: \\n94: ```typescript\\n95: import { McpServer } from \\\"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js\\\";\\n96: import { StdioServerTransport } from \\\"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js\\\";\\n97: \\n98: const server = new McpServer({\\n99:   name: \\\"Extension Name\\\",\\n100:   version: \\\"1.0.0\\\",\\n101: });\\n102: \\n103: const transport = new StdioServerTransport();\\n104: await server.connect(transport);\\n105: ```\\n106: \\n107: Kotlin:\\n108: \\n109: ```kotlin\\n110: import io.modelcontextprotocol.kotlin.sdk.server.Server\\n111: import io.modelcontextprotocol.kotlin.sdk.server.StdioServerTransport\\n112: \\n113: val server = Server(\\n114:     serverInfo = Implementation(\\n115:         name = \\\"Extension Name\\\",\\n116:         version = \\\"1.0.0\\\"\\n117:     )\\n118: )\\n119: \\n120: val transport = StdioServerTransport()\\n121: server.connect(transport)\\n122: ```\\n123: \\n124: ### 2. Implementing Resources\\n125: \\n126: Resources provide data to the LLM. Guide users through implementing resources based on these patterns:\\n127: \\n128: Python:\\n129: \\n130: ```python\\n131: @mcp.resource(\\\"example://{param}\\\")\\n132: def get_example(param: str) -> str:\\n133:     return f\\\"Data for {param}\\\"\\n134: ```\\n135: \\n136: TypeScript:\\n137: \\n138: ```typescript\\n139: server.resource(\\n140:   \\\"example\\\",\\n141:   new ResourceTemplate(\\\"example://{param}\\\", { list: undefined }),\\n142:   async (uri, { param }) => ({\\n143:     contents: [\\n144:       {\\n145:         uri: uri.href,\\n146:         text: `Data for ${param}`,\\n147:       },\\n148:     ],\\n149:   }),\\n150: );\\n151: ```\\n152: \\n153: Kotlin:\\n154: \\n155: ```kotlin\\n156: server.addResource(\\n157:     uri = \\\"example://{param}\\\",\\n158:     name = \\\"Example\\\",\\n159:     description = \\\"Example resource\\\"\\n160: ) { request ->\\n161:     ReadResourceResult(\\n162:         contents = listOf(\\n163:             TextResourceContents(\\n164:                 text = \\\"Data for ${request.params[\\\"param\\\"]}\\\",\\n165:                 uri = request.uri,\\n166:                 mimeType = \\\"text/plain\\\"\\n167:             )\\n168:         )\\n169:     )\\n170: }\\n171: ```\\n172: \\n173: ### 3. Implementing Tools\\n174: \\n175: Tools allow the LLM to take actions. Guide users through implementing tools based on these patterns:\\n176: \\n177: Python:\\n178: \\n179: ```python\\n180: @mcp.tool()\\n181: def example_tool(param: str) -> str:\\n182:     \\\"\\\"\\\"Example description for tool\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n183:     return f\\\"Processed {param}\\\"\\n184: ```\\n185: \\n186: TypeScript:\\n187: \\n188: ```typescript\\n189: server.tool(\\n190:   \\\"example-tool\\\",\\n191:   \\\"example description for tool\\\",\\n192:   { param: z.string() },\\n193:   async ({ param }) => ({\\n194:     content: [{ type: \\\"text\\\", text: `Processed ${param}` }],\\n195:   }),\\n196: );\\n197: ```\\n198: \\n199: Kotlin:\\n200: \\n201: ```kotlin\\n202: server.addTool(\\n203:     name = \\\"example-tool\\\",\\n204:     description = \\\"Example tool\\\"\\n205: ) { request ->\\n206:     ToolCallResult(\\n207:         content = listOf(\\n208:             TextContent(\\n209:                 type = \\\"text\\\",\\n210:                 text = \\\"Processed ${request.arguments[\\\"param\\\"]}\\\"\\n211:             )\\n212:         )\\n213:     )\\n214: }\\n215: ```\\n216: \\n217: ## Testing and Debugging Guide\\n218: \\n219: Help users test their MCP extension using these steps:\\n220: \\n221: ### 1. Initial Testing\\n222: \\n223: Instruct users to start a goose session with their extension.\\n224: \\n225: **Important**: You cannot start the goose session for them, as it is interactive. You will have to let them\\n226: know to start it in a terminal. Make sure you include instructions on how to setup the environment\\n227: \\n228: ```bash\\n229: # Python example\\n230: goose session --with-extension \\\"python server.py\\\"\\n231: \\n232: # TypeScript example\\n233: goose session --with-extension \\\"node server.js\\\"\\n234: \\n235: # Kotlin example\\n236: goose session --with-extension \\\"java -jar build/libs/extension.jar\\\"\\n237: ```\\n238: \\n239: Tell users to watch for startup errors. If the session fails to start, they should share the error message with you for debugging.\\n240: \\n241: Note:\\n242: You can run a feedback loop using a headless goose session, however if the process hangs you get into a stuck action.\\n243: Ask the user if they want you to do that, and let them know they will manually need to kill any stuck processes.\\n244: \\n245: ```bash\\n246: # Python example\\n247: goose run --with-extension \\\"python server.py\\\" --text \\\"EXAMPLE PROMPT HERE\\\"\\n248: \\n249: # TypeScript example\\n250: goose run --with-extension \\\"node server.js\\\" --text \\\"EXAMPLE PROMPT HERE\\\"\\n251: \\n252: # Kotlin example\\n253: goose run --with-extension \\\"java -jar build/libs/extension.jar\\\" --text \\\"EXAMPLE PROMPT HERE\\\"\\n254: ```\\n255: \\n256: ### 2. Testing Tools and Resources\\n257: \\n258: Once the session starts successfully, guide users to test their implementation:\\n259: \\n260: - For tools, they should ask goose to use the tool directly\\n261: - For resources, they should ask goose to access the relevant data\\n262: \\n263: Example prompts they can use:\\n264: \\n265: ```\\n266: \\\"Please use the example-tool with parameter 'test'\\\"\\n267: \\\"Can you read the data from example://test-param\\\"\\n268: ```\\n269: \\n270: ### 3. Adding Logging for Debugging\\n271: \\n272: If the user encounters an unclear error, guide them to add file-based logging to the server.\\n273: Here are the patterns for each SDK:\\n274: \\n275: Python:\\n276: \\n277: ```python\\n278: import logging\\n279: \\n280: logging.basicConfig(\\n281:     filename='mcp_extension.log',\\n282:     level=logging.DEBUG,\\n283:     format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'\\n284: )\\n285: \\n286: @mcp.tool()\\n287: def example_tool(param: str) -> str:\\n288:     logging.debug(f\\\"example_tool called with param: {param}\\\")\\n289:     try:\\n290:         result = f\\\"Processed {param}\\\"\\n291:         logging.debug(f\\\"example_tool succeeded: {result}\\\")\\n292:         return result\\n293:     except Exception as e:\\n294:         logging.error(f\\\"example_tool failed: {str(e)}\\\", exc_info=True)\\n295:         raise\\n296: ```\\n297: \\n298: TypeScript:\\n299: \\n300: ```typescript\\n301: import * as fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n302: \\n303: function log(message: string) {\\n304:   fs.appendFileSync(\\n305:     \\\"mcp_extension.log\\\",\\n306:     `${new Date().toISOString()} - ${message}\\\\n`,\\n307:   );\\n308: }\\n309: \\n310: server.tool(\\\"example-tool\\\", { param: z.string() }, async ({ param }) => {\\n311:   log(`example-tool called with param: ${param}`);\\n312:   try {\\n313:     const result = `Processed ${param}`;\\n314:     log(`example-tool succeeded: ${result}`);\\n315:     return {\\n316:       content: [{ type: \\\"text\\\", text: result }],\\n317:     };\\n318:   } catch (error) {\\n319:     log(`example-tool failed: ${error}`);\\n320:     throw error;\\n321:   }\\n322: });\\n323: ```\\n324: \\n325: Kotlin:\\n326: \\n327: ```kotlin\\n328: import java.io.File\\n329: import java.time.LocalDateTime\\n330: \\n331: fun log(message: String) {\\n332:     File(\\\"mcp_extension.log\\\").appendText(\\\"${LocalDateTime.now()} - $message\\\\n\\\")\\n333: }\\n334: \\n335: server.addTool(\\n336:     name = \\\"example-tool\\\",\\n337:     description = \\\"Example tool\\\"\\n338: ) { request ->\\n339:     log(\\\"example-tool called with param: ${request.arguments[\\\"param\\\"]}\\\")\\n340:     try {\\n341:         val result = \\\"Processed ${request.arguments[\\\"param\\\"]}\\\"\\n342:         log(\\\"example-tool succeeded: $result\\\")\\n343:         ToolCallResult(\\n344:             content = listOf(\\n345:                 TextContent(\\n346:                     type = \\\"text\\\",\\n347:                     text = result\\n348:                 )\\n349:             )\\n350:         )\\n351:     } catch (e: Exception) {\\n352:         log(\\\"example-tool failed: ${e.message}\\\")\\n353:         throw e\\n354:     }\\n355: }\\n356: ```\\n357: \\n358: ### 4. Debugging Process\\n359: \\n360: When users encounter issues:\\n361: \\n362: 1. First, check if there are any immediate error messages in the goose session\\n363: \\n364: 2. If the error isn't clear, guide them to:\\n365: \\n366:    - Add logging to their implementation using the patterns above\\n367:    - Restart their session with the updated code\\n368:    - Check the mcp_extension.log file for detailed error information\\n369: \\n370: 3. Common issues to watch for:\\n371: \\n372:    - Incorrect parameter types or missing parameters\\n373:    - Malformed resource URIs\\n374:    - Exceptions in tool implementation\\n375:    - Protocol message formatting errors\\n376: \\n377: 4. If users share log contents with you:\\n378:    - Look for error messages and stack traces\\n379:    - Check if parameters are being passed correctly\\n380:    - Verify the implementation matches the SDK patterns\\n381:    - Suggest specific fixes based on the error details\\n382: \\n383: ## Important Guidelines for You (the Agent)\\n384: \\n385: 1. Always start by asking the user what they want to build\\n386: \\n387: 2. Always ask the user which SDK they want to use before providing specific implementation details\\n388: \\n389: 3. Always use the reference implementations:\\n390: \\n391:    - Always clone the relevant SDK repo before starting with basic steup\\n392:    - After cloning the relevant SDK, find and `cat` the `README.md` for context\\n393:    - Use ripgrep to find specific examples within the reference\\n394:    - Reference real implementations rather than making assumptions\\n395: \\n396: 4. When building the project, if any compliation or type issues occur, _always_ check the reference SDK before making a fix.\\n397: \\n398: 5.

Scaffolding\\n\\nYou should help the user scaffold out a project directory if they don't\\nalready have one. This includes any necessary build tools or dependencies.\\n\\n**Important**:\\n\\n- Always check the reference SDK for typing and correct usage\\n- Python: Initialize a project using `uv init $PROJECT NAME`\\n- Python: Use `uv add` for all python package management, to keep `pyproject.toml` up to date\\n- Typescript: Initialize a project using `npm init -y`\\n- Kotlin: Use the following `gradle init` command to initialize:\\n  ```bash\\n    gradle init \\\\\\n      --type kotlin-application \\\\\\n      --dsl kotlin \\\\\\n      --test-framework junit-jupiter \\\\\\n      --package my.project \\\\\\n      --project-name $PROJECT_NAME  \\\\\\n      --no-split-project  \\\\\\n      --java-version 21\\n  ```\\n\\nInclude the relevant SDK package:\\n\\n1. `mcp` for python\\n2. `\\\"io.modelcontextprotocol:kotlin-sdk:0.3.0\\\"` for kotlin\\n3. `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for typescript\\n\\n**Important for kotlin development:**\\nTo get started with a Kotlin MCP server, look at the kotlin-mcp-server example included\\nin the Kotlin SDK. After cloning the SDK repository, you can find this sample inside the\\nsamples/kotlin-mcp-server directory. There, you'll see how the Gradle build files,\\nproperties, and settings are configured, as well as the initial set of dependencies. Use\\nthese existing gradle configurations to get the user started. Be sure to check out the\\nMain.kt file for a basic implementation that you can build upon.\\n\\n### 1. Basic Server Setup\\n\\nHelp the user create their initial server file. Here are some patterns to get started with:\\n\\nPython:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\\nfrom mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server\\n\\nmcp = FastMCP(\\\"Extension Name\\\")\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    mcp.run()\\n```\\n\\nTypeScript:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { McpServer } from \\\"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js\\\";\\nimport { StdioServerTransport } from \\\"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js\\\";\\n\\nconst server = new McpServer({\\n  name: \\\"Extension Name\\\",\\n  version: \\\"1.0.0\\\",\\n});\\n\\nconst transport = new StdioServerTransport();\\nawait server.connect(transport);\\n```\\n\\nKotlin:\\n\\n```kotlin\\nimport io.modelcontextprotocol.kotlin.sdk.server.Server\\nimport io.modelcontextprotocol.kotlin.sdk.server.StdioServerTransport\\n\\nval server = Server(\\n    serverInfo = Implementation(\\n        name = \\\"Extension Name\\\",\\n        version = \\\"1.0.0\\\"\\n    )\\n)\\n\\nval transport = StdioServerTransport()\\nserver.connect(transport)\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Implementing Resources\\n\\nResources provide data to the LLM. Guide users through implementing resources based on these patterns:\\n\\nPython:\\n\\n```python\\n@mcp.resource(\\\"example://{param}\\\")\\ndef get_example(param: str) -> str:\\n    return f\\\"Data for {param}\\\"\\n```\\n\\nTypeScript:\\n\\n```typescript\\nserver.resource(\\n  \\\"example\\\",\\n  new ResourceTemplate(\\\"example://{param}\\\", { list: undefined }),\\n  async (uri, { param }) => ({\\n    contents: [\\n      {\\n        uri: uri.href,\\n        text: `Data for ${param}`,\\n      },\\n    ],\\n  }),\\n);\\n```\\n\\nKotlin:\\n\\n```kotlin\\nserver.addResource(\\n    uri = \\\"example://{param}\\\",\\n    name = \\\"Example\\\",\\n    description = \\\"Example resource\\\"\\n) { request ->\\n    ReadResourceResult(\\n        contents = listOf(\\n            TextResourceContents(\\n                text = \\\"Data for ${request.params[\\\"param\\\"]}\\\",\\n                uri = request.uri,\\n                mimeType = \\\"text/plain\\\"\\n            )\\n        )\\n    )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Implementing Tools\\n\\nTools allow the LLM to take actions. Guide users through implementing tools based on these patterns:\\n\\nPython:\\n\\n```python\\n@mcp.tool()\\ndef example_tool(param: str) -> str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Example description for tool\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    return f\\\"Processed {param}\\\"\\n```\\n\\nTypeScript:\\n\\n```typescript\\nserver.tool(\\n  \\\"example-tool\\\",\\n  \\\"example description for tool\\\",\\n  { param: z.string() },\\n  async ({ param }) => ({\\n    content: [{ type: \\\"text\\\", text: `Processed ${param}` }],\\n  }),\\n);\\n```\\n\\nKotlin:\\n\\n```kotlin\\nserver.addTool(\\n    name = \\\"example-tool\\\",\\n    description = \\\"Example tool\\\"\\n) { request ->\\n    ToolCallResult(\\n        content = listOf(\\n            TextContent(\\n                type = \\\"text\\\",\\n                text = \\\"Processed ${request.arguments[\\\"param\\\"]}\\\"\\n            )\\n        )\\n    )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Testing and Debugging Guide\\n\\nHelp users test their MCP extension using these steps:\\n\\n### 1. Initial Testing\\n\\nInstruct users to start a goose session with their extension.\\n\\n**Important**: You cannot start the goose session for them, as it is interactive. You will have to let them\\nknow to start it in a terminal. Make sure you include instructions on how to setup the environment\\n\\n```bash\\n# Python example\\ngoose session --with-extension \\\"python server.py\\\"\\n\\n# TypeScript example\\ngoose session --with-extension \\\"node server.js\\\"\\n\\n# Kotlin example\\ngoose session --with-extension \\\"java -jar build/libs/extension.jar\\\"\\n```\\n\\nTell users to watch for startup errors. If the session fails to start, they should share the error message with you for debugging.\\n\\nNote:\\nYou can run a feedback loop using a headless goose session, however if the process hangs you get into a stuck action.\\nAsk the user if they want you to do that, and let them know they will manually need to kill any stuck processes.\\n\\n```bash\\n# Python example\\ngoose run --with-extension \\\"python server.py\\\" --text \\\"EXAMPLE PROMPT HERE\\\"\\n\\n# TypeScript example\\ngoose run --with-extension \\\"node server.js\\\" --text \\\"EXAMPLE PROMPT HERE\\\"\\n\\n# Kotlin example\\ngoose run --with-extension \\\"java -jar build/libs/extension.jar\\\" --text \\\"EXAMPLE PROMPT HERE\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Testing Tools and Resources\\n\\nOnce the session starts successfully, guide users to test their implementation:\\n\\n- For tools, they should ask goose to use the tool directly\\n- For resources, they should ask goose to access the relevant data\\n\\nExample prompts they can use:\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Please use the example-tool with parameter 'test'\\\"\\n\\\"Can you read the data from example://test-param\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Adding Logging for Debugging\\n\\nIf the user encounters an unclear error, guide them to add file-based logging to the server.\\nHere are the patterns for each SDK:\\n\\nPython:\\n\\n```python\\nimport logging\\n\\nlogging.basicConfig(\\n    filename='mcp_extension.log',\\n    level=logging.DEBUG,\\n    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'\\n)\\n\\n@mcp.tool()\\ndef example_tool(param: str) -> str:\\n    logging.debug(f\\\"example_tool called with param: {param}\\\")\\n    try:\\n        result = f\\\"Processed {param}\\\"\\n        logging.debug(f\\\"example_tool succeeded: {result}\\\")\\n        return result\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        logging.error(f\\\"example_tool failed: {str(e)}\\\", exc_info=True)\\n        raise\\n```\\n\\nTypeScript:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport * as fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\nfunction log(message: string) {\\n  fs.appendFileSync(\\n    \\\"mcp_extension.log\\\",\\n    `${new Date().toISOString()} - ${message}\\\\n`,\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nserver.tool(\\\"example-tool\\\", { param: z.string() }, async ({ param }) => {\\n  log(`example-tool called with param: ${param}`);\\n  try {\\n    const result = `Processed ${param}`;\\n    log(`example-tool succeeded: ${result}`);\\n    return {\\n      content: [{ type: \\\"text\\\", text: result }],\\n    };\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    log(`example-tool failed: ${error}`);\\n    throw error;\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\n\\nKotlin:\\n\\n```kotlin\\nimport java.io.File\\nimport java.time.LocalDateTime\\n\\nfun log(message: String) {\\n    File(\\\"mcp_extension.log\\\").appendText(\\\"${LocalDateTime.now()} - $message\\\\n\\\")\\n}\\n\\nserver.addTool(\\n    name = \\\"example-tool\\\",\\n    description = \\\"Example tool\\\"\\n) { request ->\\n    log(\\\"example-tool called with param: ${request.arguments[\\\"param\\\"]}\\\")\\n    try {\\n        val result = \\\"Processed ${request.arguments[\\\"param\\\"]}\\\"\\n        log(\\\"example-tool succeeded: $result\\\")\\n        ToolCallResult(\\n            content = listOf(\\n                TextContent(\\n                    type = \\\"text\\\",\\n                    text = result\\n                )\\n            )\\n        )\\n    } catch (e: Exception) {\\n        log(\\\"example-tool failed: ${e.message}\\\")\\n        throw e\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4.

When helping with implementations:\n\n   - Start with the basic server setup\n   - Add one resource or tool at a time\n   - Test each addition before moving on\n\n6. Common Gotchas to Watch For:\n\n   - Python: Ensure decorators are properly imported\n   - TypeScript: Remember to import zod for parameter validation\n   - Kotlin: Pay attention to proper type declarations\n\n7. When users ask about implementation details:\n   - First check the reference SDK\n   - Use ripgrep to find relevant examples\n   - Provide context-specific guidance based on their SDK choice\n\nRemember: Your role is to guide and explain, adapting based on the user's needs and questions. Don't dump all implementation details at once - help users build their extension step by step.\n\n---\n\n**‚úÖ Successfully fetched all 415 lines** of the tutorial document from the GitHub repository using `curl`!"}},{"task_id":"fd55594d-50c3-470d-93da-a5787a460127","status":"Completed","data":{"result":"Use curl to fetch the raw content from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/block/goose/main/documentation/blog/2025-02-17-agentic-ai-mcp/index.md and display the complete content.

Because ChatGPT doesn't have access to my codebase, it would speculate on the cause of my error and give me a couple of possible solutions to try. I'd then manually try these proposed solutions and return to inform ChatGPT of the results. We'd continue this back and forth until the error is resolved or I give up.\\\\n21: \\\\n22: AI Agents greatly simplify this flow by talking with the LLM on my behalf and taking direct action to fix the problem.\\\\n23: \\\\n24: > _**An AI agent is a system that operates autonomously to accomplish a goal.**_\\\\n25: \\\\n26: Because AI agents are connected to systems, they can analyze a situation, determine the next action, and execute it without much, if any, human intervention. This capability turns them from passive chatbots into automation assistants.\\\\n27: \\\\n28: By using an AI agent, I can simply say \\\\\\\"fix the error\\\\\\\" and it'll have context about what's wrong and automatically fix the error for me.\\\\n29: \\\\n30: ## How AI Agents Work with LLMs\\\\n31: \\\\n32: LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0, etc) provide cognitive abilities to AI agents. Most AI agents will have a chat interface themselves where you type your prompt, and the agent will send this prompt to an LLM. At the same time, the agent will also inform the LLM of what **tools** it has access to.\\\\n33: \\\\n34: ### Tool Calling\\\\n35: \\\\n36: Tools are one of the most important aspects of agentic AI. AI agents are able to execute API calls via **tool calling**.\\\\n37: \\\\n38: Let's look at an example:\\\\n39: \\\\n40: 1. A user sends a prompt to their AI agent: _\\\\\\\"Fix the NullPointerException in my UserService.java file.\\\\\\\"_\\\\n41: \\\\n42: 2. The agent sends the user request and the list of its available tools to the LLM in a structured format.\\\\n43: ```\\\\n44: User Request: \\\\\\\"Fix the NullPointerException in my UserService.java file.\\\\\\\"\\\\n45: \\\\n46: Available Tools:\\\\n47: 1. read_file(file_path: str) ‚Üí Returns the contents of the specified file.\\\\n48: 2. analyze_code(file_content: str) ‚Üí Identifies potential errors and suggests fixes.\\\\n49: 3. edit_file(file_path: str, modifications: dict) ‚Üí Applies code changes.\\\\n50: 4. run_tests() ‚Üí Executes the test suite and returns results.\\\\n51: ```\\\\n52: \\\\n53: 3. The LLM analyzes the request and selects the appropriate tools. It determines that it needs to read the file in order to help.\\\\n54: ```json\\\\n55: [\\\\n56:   {\\\\n57:     \\\\\\\"tool\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"read_file\\\\\\\",\\\\n58:     \\\\\\\"parameters\\\\\\\": { \\\\\\\"file_path\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"UserService.java\\\\\\\" }\\\\n59:   }\\\\n60: ]\\\\n61: ```\\\\n62: \\\\n63: 4. The agent executes `read_file()` and sends the code to the LLM.\\\\n64: ```java\\\\n65: public class UserService {\\\\n66:     private Database db;\\\\n67: \\\\n68:     public void getUser(String userId) {\\\\n69:         System.out.println(db.findUserById(userId).getName());\\\\n70:     }\\\\n71: }\\\\n72: ```\\\\n73: \\\\n74: 5. The LLM recognizes the issue (`db` variable is not initialized) and now selects another tool to fix the issue.\\\\n75: ```json\\\\n76: [\\\\n77:   {\\\\n78:     \\\\\\\"tool\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"edit_file\\\\\\\",\\\\n79:     \\\\\\\"parameters\\\\\\\": {\\\\n80:       \\\\\\\"file_path\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"UserService.java\\\\\\\",\\\\n81:       \\\\\\\"modifications\\\\\\\": {\\\\n82:         \\\\\\\"line_number\\\\\\\": 3,\\\\n83:         \\\\\\\"replacement\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"private Database db = new Database();\\\\\\\"\\\\n84:       }\\\\n85:     }\\\\n86:   }\\\\n87: ]\\\\n88: ```\\\\n89: \\\\n90: 6. The agent executes `edit_file()` to fix `UserService.java` and informs the LLM.\\\\n91: \\\\n92: 7. The LLM determines that it's a good idea to run tests to confirm the change.\\\\n93: ```json\\\\n94: [\\\\n95:   {\\\\n96:     \\\\\\\"tool\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"run_tests\\\\\\\",\\\\n97:     \\\\\\\"parameters\\\\\\\": {}\\\\n98:   }\\\\n99: ]\\\\n100: ```\\\\n101: \\\\n102: 8. The agent executes `run_tests()` and provides the results to the LLM.\\\\n103: ```json\\\\n104: {\\\\n105:   \\\\\\\"tests_passed\\\\\\\": true,\\\\n106:   \\\\\\\"failed_tests\\\\\\\": []\\\\n107: }\\\\n108: ```\\\\n109: \\\\n110: 9. The LLM generates a final message that the agent then presents to the user.\\\\n111: ```\\\\n112: I‚Äôve fixed the NullPointerException in UserService.java by initializing the db variable. All tests have passed. Let me know if you need further modifications!\\\\n113: ```\\\\n114: \\\\n115: Without tool calling, LLMs would only guess answers based on their training data. But by using tools, agents can directly access the data they need to make accurate decisions and take actions.\\\\n116: \\\\n117: It's worth noting that not all agents are the same when it comes to tool access. Most proprietary agents are tightly scoped to a specific LLM and a predefined set of tools, as companies build agents tailored for their own applications.\\\\n118: \\\\n119: Other agents, like goose, are more extensible, allowing users to configure it with the LLM of their choice, as well as add tools for various APIs, databases, and even [local environments like IDEs](/docs/mcp/jetbrains-mcp). However, for agents to scale across different tools and systems without requiring custom integrations for each one, they need a standardized way to discover, call, and manage tools. This is exactly what the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) provides.\\\\n120: \\\\n121: ## MCP Ecosystem\\\\n122: \\\\n123: Traditional AI integrations require custom API calls for every system, making scaling difficult. MCP solves this by providing an open, universal protocol for agents to communicate with external systems dynamically.\\\\n124: \\\\n125: With MCP, an agent like goose can:\\\\n126: \\\\n127: * connect to any API without a developer writing manual integration code\\\\n128: * integrate with cloud services, dev tools, databases, and enterprise systems\\\\n129: * retrieve and store context to enhance reasoning\\\\n130: \\\\n131: At the time of this writing, there are more than [1000 MCP servers](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers) (systems that expose tools) that any MCP-enabled AI agent like goose can connect to! These MCP servers act as bridges between agents and external systems, enabling access to APIs, databases, and development environments. Some were developed by the official API providers, while the vast majority were developed by community members. Because MCP is an open standard, anyone can build an MCP server for any resource. This greatly increases the possibilities of AI agents!\\\\n132: \\\\n133: For example, let's say I want goose to develop a new web app for me in my WebStorm IDE based on a Figma design and then commit the code to a new repo in GitHub. I can add the following MCP Servers as goose extensions to give it all of these capabilities:\\\\n134: \\\\n135: * [Figma](/docs/mcp/figma-mcp)\\\\n136: * [JetBrains](/docs/mcp/jetbrains-mcp)\\\\n137: * [GitHub](/docs/mcp/github-mcp)\\\\n138: \\\\n139: With this, I can prompt my AI agent in natural language and it'll take care of the work:\\\\n140: \\\\n141: > _\\\\\\\"Based on the figma design with file ID XYZ, build a web app in WebStorm and commit the code to a new GitHub repo named angiejones/myapp\\\\\\\"_\\\\n142: \\\\n143: Pretty powerful, right?! \\\\n144: \\\\n145: ## Get Started with AI Agents\\\\n146: Hopefully this has provided clear insight into what are AI agents, how they work, and what they can enable for you.

I was able to fetch the complete raw content from the URL. Here's the **complete markdown file** (160 lines) from the goose documentation blog:\n\n---\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Agentic AI and the MCP Ecosystem\ndescription: A 101 introduction to AI Agents\nauthors: \n    - angie\n---\n\n![blog banner](agentic-ai-with-mcp.png)\n\nIt seems like yesterday when we all were wowed by generative AI and specifically the chat interfaces that made interacting with large language models (LLMs) accessible to everyday people.\n\nAs amazing as this was, it was only the beginning. The next wave of AI is agentic, meaning AI systems that don't just respond to prompts but take actions, make decisions, and interact with external systems. This is accomplished via **AI agents**.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n## What are AI Agents?\n\nWhen you interact with chatbots that use AI, like ChatGPT, you can ask it how to do something, and it'll provide step-by-step instructions.\n\nFor example, if I ran into an error while coding, I could paste the error message into ChatGPT and ask it to help me debug. Because ChatGPT doesn't have access to my codebase, it would speculate on the cause of my error and give me a couple of possible solutions to try. I'd then manually try these proposed solutions and return to inform ChatGPT of the results. We'd continue this back and forth until the error is resolved or I give up.\n\nAI Agents greatly simplify this flow by talking with the LLM on my behalf and taking direct action to fix the problem.\n\n> _**An AI agent is a system that operates autonomously to accomplish a goal.**_\n\nBecause AI agents are connected to systems, they can analyze a situation, determine the next action, and execute it without much, if any, human intervention. This capability turns them from passive chatbots into automation assistants.\n\nBy using an AI agent, I can simply say \"fix the error\" and it'll have context about what's wrong and automatically fix the error for me.\n\n## How AI Agents Work with LLMs\n\nLLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0, etc) provide cognitive abilities to AI agents. Most AI agents will have a chat interface themselves where you type your prompt, and the agent will send this prompt to an LLM. At the same time, the agent will also inform the LLM of what **tools** it has access to.\n\n### Tool Calling\n\nTools are one of the most important aspects of agentic AI. AI agents are able to execute API calls via **tool calling**.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n1. A user sends a prompt to their AI agent: _\"Fix the NullPointerException in my UserService.java file.\"_\n\n2. The agent sends the user request and the list of its available tools to the LLM in a structured format.\n```\nUser Request: \"Fix the NullPointerException in my UserService.java file.\"\n\nAvailable Tools:\n1. read_file(file_path: str) ‚Üí Returns the contents of the specified file.\n2. analyze_code(file_content: str) ‚Üí Identifies potential errors and suggests fixes.\n3. edit_file(file_path: str, modifications: dict) ‚Üí Applies code changes.\n4. run_tests() ‚Üí Executes the test suite and returns results.\n```\n\n3. The LLM analyzes the request and selects the appropriate tools. It determines that it needs to read the file in order to help.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"tool\": \"read_file\",\n    \"parameters\": { \"file_path\": \"UserService.java\" }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n4. The agent executes `read_file()` and sends the code to the LLM.\n```java\npublic class UserService {\n    private Database db;\n\n    public void getUser(String userId) {\n        System.out.println(db.findUserById(userId).getName());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5. The LLM recognizes the issue (`db` variable is not initialized) and now selects another tool to fix the issue.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"tool\": \"edit_file\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"file_path\": \"UserService.java\",\n      \"modifications\": {\n        \"line_number\": 3,\n        \"replacement\": \"private Database db = new Database();\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n6. The agent executes `edit_file()` to fix `UserService.java` and informs the LLM.\n\n7. The LLM determines that it's a good idea to run tests to confirm the change.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"tool\": \"run_tests\",\n    \"parameters\": {}\n  }\n]\n```\n\n8. The agent executes `run_tests()` and provides the results to the LLM.\n```json\n{\n  \"tests_passed\": true,\n  \"failed_tests\": []\n}\n```\n\n9. The LLM generates a final message that the agent then presents to the user.\n```\nI've fixed the NullPointerException in UserService.java by initializing the db variable. All tests have passed. Let me know if you need further modifications!\n```\n\nWithout tool calling, LLMs would only guess answers based on their training data. But by using tools, agents can directly access the data they need to make accurate decisions and take actions.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all agents are the same when it comes to tool access. Most proprietary agents are tightly scoped to a specific LLM and a predefined set of tools, as companies build agents tailored for their own applications.\n\nOther agents, like goose, are more extensible, allowing users to configure it with the LLM of their choice, as well as add tools for various APIs, databases, and even [local environments like IDEs](/docs/mcp/jetbrains-mcp).

And vibe code with peace of mind.**\n\n<head>\n  <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"How to Determine If An MCP Server Is Safe\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/03/21/goose-vscode\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Before you plug your agent into just any MCP server, here's how to check if it's actually safe.\" />\n  <meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"http://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/mcpsafety-87eb7ace7163a5edbe068ff75b79a199.png\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" />\n  <meta property=\"twitter:domain\" content=\"block.github.io/goose\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:title\" content=\"How to Determine If An MCP Server Is Safe\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:description\" content=\"Before you plug your agent into just any MCP server, here's how to check if it's actually safe.\" />\n  <meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"http://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/mcpsafety-87eb7ace7163a5edbe068ff75b79a199.png\" />\n</head>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is a **Goose blog post** dated **March 26, 2025**, written by **Ebony**, about **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server security**.

58: ### Summary:
59: A comprehensive blog post by Angie (February 17, 2025) providing a **101 introduction to AI Agents** and the MCP ecosystem.
60: 
61: **Key Topics:**
62: 
63: 1. **What are AI Agents?**
64:    - Definition: Systems that operate autonomously to accomplish goals
65:    - Different from chatbots that only provide instructions
66:    - Can analyze situations, determine actions, and execute without human intervention
67: 
68: 2. **How AI Agents Work with LLMs**
69:    - LLMs provide cognitive abilities to agents
70:    - **Tool Calling**: Most important aspect of agentic AI
71:    - Detailed 9-step example of fixing a NullPointerException in Java
72: 
73: 3. **MCP Ecosystem**
74:    - 1000+ MCP servers available at time of writing
75:    - Provides universal protocol for agents to communicate with external systems
76:    - Examples: Figma, JetBrains, GitHub integrations
77:    - Anyone can build MCP servers (open standard)
78: 
79: 4. **Practical Example:**
80:    - Build a web app from Figma design in WebStorm IDE and commit to GitHub
81:    - All done through natural language prompts to goose

89: ### Summary:
90: A blog post by Ebony (March 26, 2025) about **vetting MCP servers for security** before connecting AI agents.
91: 
92: **Key Points:**
93: 
94: - **The Problem**: 3,000+ MCP servers exist, many community-built with minimal governance
95: - MCP servers get access to your workflows and data
96: - **The Solution**: Use **[Glama.ai](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers)** as a directory
97: 
98: **What Glama Scores:**
99: - ‚úÖ **Security** ‚Äì Checks for known vulnerabilities
100: - ‚úÖ **License** ‚Äì Confirms permissive open source license
101: - ‚úÖ **Quality** ‚Äì Server functionality verification
102: 
103: **Additional Context:**
104: - Server metadata (tools count, README, last updated, preview support)
105: - Regular reevaluations for ongoing security monitoring
106: - Example: YouTube MCP server with all A's
107: 
108: **Bottom Line:** Check before you connect to avoid security issues!
