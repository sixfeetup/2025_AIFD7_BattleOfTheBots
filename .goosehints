# Goose Hints: IndyPy 2025 — Battle of the Bots

Project conventions

- Slides authoring
  - Presenter notes: always use a Markdown fenced block with exactly this form:
    ::: notes
    - Keep notes concise (≤4 bullets) and actionable
    - Use for speaker-only clarifications, caveats, and sources
    :::
  - "What's New" slides: keep bullets short; lead with bolded category labels (e.g., **v2.0**, **Plugins**, **MCP**)
  - Maintain consistent style across tools (Aider, Claude Code, Cursor, Goose, Junie, Codex)
  - Model/version claims must include sources (links) in the presenter notes, not in the main bullets
  - MCP statements: do not present MCP as new for Claude Code; clarify it's supported since 2024

- Formatting
  - Use Markdown; avoid heavy formatting in bullets
  - Use r-fit-text headings as in existing slides
  - Place presenter notes immediately after the slide section they refer to

- Git
  - Commit slide edits with concise messages
