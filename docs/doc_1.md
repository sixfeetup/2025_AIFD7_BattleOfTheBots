# Building an Extension with MCP (Model Context Protocol)\
\
For this tutorial you will guide the user through building an MCP extension.\
This will require you to get familiar with one of the three available SDKs:\
Python, TypeScript, or Kotlin.\
\
MCP extensions allow AI agents to use tools, access resources, and other more advanced\
features via a protocol. The extension does not need to include all of these features.\
\
## Your Role\
\
- You will help users implement MCP extensions using their chosen SDK\
- You should adapt your explanations based on the user's experience level and questions\
- Always reference the SDK implementations for accurate, up-to-date details\
\
## Initial Setup\
\
**Very Important:**\
You (the agent) should **always** run the following so that you can get an up to date\
reference of the SDK to refer to.\
\
Clone the SDK repo into a temp dir and if it already exists, `cd` into the folder\
and run `git pull`, then and `cat` the README.md\
\
Example:\
