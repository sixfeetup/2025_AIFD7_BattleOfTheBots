# How I Vet MCP Servers Before Plugging Them In\\\
\\\
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) servers are everywhere right now. Last time I checked there were **3,000 and counting**. Every day, a new one pops up, letting AI agents like Goose access files, query your Google Drive, search the web, and unlock all kinds of amazing integrations.\\\
\\\

\\\
And just when I thought things couldn't get any crazier, Zapier blessed us with an MCP server. That means your agent can now tap into over 8,000+ integrations.\\\
\\\
So trust me, I know it's super tempting to want to plug your AI agent into everything and just _see_ what happens.\\\
\\\
But hold on a minute, we can't afford to skip over security.\\\
\\\
When you connect to an MCP server, you're giving it access to your workflows, most times even your data. And a lot of these servers are community built, with little to no governance.\\\
\\\
## Here's What I Do Before I Trust an MCP Server\\\
\\\
Any time I'm checking out a new MCP server to plug into Goose, I start with **[Glama.ai](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers)**.\\\
\\\
Glama is an all-in-one AI workspace, and it maintains one of the **most comprehensive and security-aware MCP server directories** that I've seen. The servers listed are either community built or created by the actual companies behind the tools, like **Azure** or **JetBrains**.\\\
\\\
Each server gets a **report card**, so at a glance you can quickly assess whether it's solid or a little sketchy.\\\
\\\
## What Glama Scores\\\
\\\
Here's what Glama grades servers on:\\\
\\\
- ✅ **Security** – Checks for known vulnerabilities in the server or its dependencies  \\\
- ✅ **License** – Confirms it's using a permissive open source license  \\\
- ✅ **Quality** – Indicates whether the server is running and functions as expected\\\
\\\
You'll also see helpful context like how many tools the server exposes, whether it has a README file, when it was last updated, and whether it supports live previews through the MCP inspector tool.\\\
\\\
Glama doesn't just perform these checks once, they **revaluate servers regularly**, so if something breaks or a vulnerability gets introduced, the score updates automatically.\\\
\\\
Here's an example of a solid server: the **YouTube MCP server**, which lets Goose download and process videos to create summaries and transcripts.\\\
\\\

\\\
>_All A's across the board—**security, license, and quality**._  \\\
\\\
That's exactly the kind of score I look for before I plug Goose into any server.\\\
\\\
So please, **check before you connect**.\\\
\\\
A quick glance at an MCP directory like Glama can save you from crying on your office floor later. However, once you've done your homework?\\\
\\\
**Have fun. Plug your agent in. Break things (safely). And vibe code with peace of mind.**\\\
