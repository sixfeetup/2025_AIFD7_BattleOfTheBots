41: ### Summary:
42: A blog post by Angie (December 10, 2024) about how **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** enables AI agents to connect with external systems through open standards.
43: 
44: **Key Points:**
45: - Discusses the importance of open standards (like Wi-Fi, TCP/IP, HTTP) for interoperable systems
46: - Introduces MCP as an open standard by Anthropic for connecting LLMs to external systems
47: - Explains how MCP simplifies integrations for goose (e.g., GitHub workflows)
48: - Before MCP: developers needed custom integrations for each system
49: - With MCP: standardized interface handles authentication and API complexity
50: - Encourages adoption to build a more interoperable AI ecosystem

58: ### Summary:
59: A comprehensive blog post by Angie (February 17, 2025) providing a **101 introduction to AI Agents** and the MCP ecosystem.
60: 
61: **Key Topics:**
62: 
63: 1. **What are AI Agents?**
64:    - Definition: Systems that operate autonomously to accomplish goals
65:    - Different from chatbots that only provide instructions
66:    - Can analyze situations, determine actions, and execute without human intervention
67: 
68: 2. **How AI Agents Work with LLMs**
69:    - LLMs provide cognitive abilities to agents
70:    - **Tool Calling**: Most important aspect of agentic AI
71:    - Detailed 9-step example of fixing a NullPointerException in Java
72: 
73: 3. **MCP Ecosystem**
74:    - 1000+ MCP servers available at time of writing
75:    - Provides universal protocol for agents to communicate with external systems
76:    - Examples: Figma, JetBrains, GitHub integrations
77:    - Anyone can build MCP servers (open standard)
78: 
79: 4. **Practical Example:**
80:    - Build a web app from Figma design in WebStorm IDE and commit to GitHub
81:    - All done through natural language prompts to goose

89: ### Summary:
90: A blog post by Ebony (March 26, 2025) about **vetting MCP servers for security** before connecting AI agents.
91: 
92: **Key Points:**
93: 
94: - **The Problem**: 3,000+ MCP servers exist, many community-built with minimal governance
95: - MCP servers get access to your workflows and data
96: - **The Solution**: Use **[Glama.ai](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers)** as a directory
97: 
98: **What Glama Scores:**
99: - ‚úÖ **Security** ‚Äì Checks for known vulnerabilities
100: - ‚úÖ **License** ‚Äì Confirms permissive open source license
101: - ‚úÖ **Quality** ‚Äì Server functionality verification
102: 
103: **Additional Context:**
104: - Server metadata (tools count, README, last updated, preview support)
105: - Regular reevaluations for ongoing security monitoring
106: - Example: YouTube MCP server with all A's
107: 
108: **Bottom Line:** Check before you connect to avoid security issues!

116: ### Summary:
117: A comprehensive **tutorial guide for building MCP extensions** for goose, supporting Python, TypeScript, and Kotlin SDKs.
118: 
119: **Content Structure:**
120: 
121: ### **Your Role as Agent:**
122: - Help users implement MCP extensions
123: - Adapt explanations based on experience level
124: - Always reference SDK implementations
125: 
126: ### **Initial Setup:**
127: - Clone SDK repos for reference
128: - Use ripgrep to find examples
129: - Reference real implementations
130: 
131: ### **0. Scaffolding:**
132: - Python: `uv init` and `uv add` for packages
133: - TypeScript: `npm init -y`
134: - Kotlin: Detailed `gradle init` command
135: - SDK packages: `mcp`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `io.modelcontextprotocol:kotlin-sdk`
136: 
137: ### **1. Basic Server Setup:**
138: Complete code examples for all three languages showing initial server configuration
139: 
140: ### **2. Implementing Resources:**
141: Resource patterns for providing data to LLMs in all three languages
142: 
143: ### **3. Implementing Tools:**
144: Tool patterns for allowing LLMs to take actions in all three languages
145: 
146: ### **Testing and Debugging:**
147: 
148: **1. Initial Testing:**
149: ```bash
150: goose session --with-extension "python server.py"
151: goose session --with-extension "node server.js"
152: goose session --with-extension "java -jar build/libs/extension.jar"
153: ```
154: 
155: **2. Testing Tools and Resources:**
156: Example prompts for validation
157: 
158: **3. Adding Logging:**

160: 
161: **4. Debugging Process:**
162: - Check error messages
163: - Add logging
164: - Watch for common issues (parameter types, URIs, exceptions)
165: - Verify against SDK patterns
166: 
167: ### **Important Guidelines:**
168: - Always start by asking what to build
169: - Ask which SDK to use
170: - Use reference implementations
171: - Check reference SDK for compilation issues
172: - Start with basic setup, add features incrementally
173: - Watch for SDK-specific gotchas
